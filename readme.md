# A data synthesis and meta-analysis on outcomes of conservatively managed brain aneurysms

* The first step is to work out a summary proportion ie risk of rupture of conservatively managed brain aneurysms measuring 10 mm or less. 

* Then the relative risk of rupture will be analysed by using size and prior subarachnoid haemorrhage as the moderators. 

* The final analyses will be submitted to a medical journal for peer review and publication.
