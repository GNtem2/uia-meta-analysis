# A data synthesis and meta-analysis on outcomes of conservatively managed brain aneurysms

My goal is to learn how to conduct a quantitative synthesis to better understand the current literature on the rupture of an intracranial aneurysm with conservative management. 

After performing my systematic review, I have three aims:

1. To quantitatively synthesise the data in order to calculate a summary pooled proportion.
2. To calculate heterogeniety across the studies to help consider whether pooling is appropriate. 
3. If pooling is appropriate, then to explore the heterogeneity by considering pre-specified sub-group analysis and post hoc meteregression. 

The statistical approaches will be tailored to the source dataset and structure of the data which is characterised by the following:

1. Rupture of an intracranial aneurysm in a single patient is a rare event.
2. Small number of rupture outcome events in the sample populations, with the proportion very close to zero.
3. While the outcome of rupture is binomial, in the sample population, the distribution of rupture outcomes over time is is better described by the non-central hypergeometric distribution.
4. there are a wide range of size in sample populations identified by the systemaic review, with both very small studies and very large studies included.

To achieve these aims, the various packages and source dataset in R are loaded, and each part carried out with an explanation of the rationale for the data analysis. Version control is carred out with GitHub.
