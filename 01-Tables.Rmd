```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

###Load packages

```{r load packages, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(huxtable)

```

#### Load required data

A single excel data file is loaded to carry out all data table creation, with all steps documented below to ensure reproducibility of research.

```{r load data, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}

maindata <- read_csv("data/maindata.csv")
```






```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
